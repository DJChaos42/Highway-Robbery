# Highway Robbery | v1.0.0
Minecraft's version 1.21 experimental data pack enables players to craft copper doors and trapdoors, but at an absurdly
expensive price. This data pack modifies those recipes to mirror the cost of crafting iron doors and trapdoors. It still
allows copper blocks in the various oxidized states to be used to make their respective versions of the doors, but the
output has been increased to match the new recipes.

## Important Notes
This pack must be loaded after the Update 1.21 data pack or else the recipes will not be properly replaced. This is also
true for players using Misode's "Update 1.21 without trial chambers" pack. You can do this by moving it above those
packs when creating a new world. If you want to use a data pack loader mod, I recommend [Paxi](https://modrinth.com/mod/paxi), as it allows you to
specify the order in which packs should load using a config.
